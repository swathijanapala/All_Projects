SUMMARY:

In the quiet town of Porbandar, on a warm October day in 1869, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born into a modest family.
Little did the world know that this unassuming child would grow up to become a beacon of hope and a symbol of nonviolent resistance.
Returning to India, he experienced the bitter taste of discrimination when he was forcibly removed from a whites-only train compartment.
He advocated for civil disobedience and self-reliance, urging his fellow citizens to spin their own cloth and reject foreign-made goods.
He endured imprisonment,faced criticism from various quarters, and even undertook multiple hunger strikes to promote communal harmony.
Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Orissa, Subhas was imbued with a deep sense of patriotism from a young age.
He grew up with a fervent desire to see India free from the shackles of British rule.
In 1929, he was elected as the president of the Indian National Congress, the largest political party in the country.
Bose's methods were often unconventional. He believed that mere words were insufficient to win India's freedom.
When World War II erupted, Bose saw an opportunity to exploit the British Empire's vulnerabilities.
